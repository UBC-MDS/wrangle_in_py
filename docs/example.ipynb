She could do this by examining her dataframe, noting down the columns to remove, then deleting the columns with the pandas .drop() function. But there's a better way! The function column_drop_threshold in this package will calculate the proportion of missing data in all the columns and remove the columns that have too much missing data, based on a threshold specified by Susie (or you, the user)! The function also has an optional argument which when included will delete any columns that have a lower coefficient of variance than specified. In this way if there's a column with the same value stored for every example we can remove it without having to examine the dataframe to identify columns that fit this description."
